Feature: Airflow

Output patches: "AF_Airflow [g/s]"

Sub-features:
- Speed density.
- Alpha-N.
- MAF.

The Airflow feature will generate the flow of air for the entire engine in grams per second. 

The Speed density feature will generate the airflow using a theoretical model of the airflow characteristics of the engine. This is genrally accomplished with a pressure measurement in the system.

The Alpha-N feature will generate the airflow using a theoretical model of the airflow characteristics of the engine. This is genrally accomplished without a pressure measurement. The throttle position is generally used.

The MAF method is a direct meaasurement of the system airflow using a dedicated airflow sensor.
